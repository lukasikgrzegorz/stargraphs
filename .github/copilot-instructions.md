## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15.3
- TypeScript 5
- React 19
- Tailwind 4

## FRONTEND

#### Tailwind

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus-visible:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements

### Guidelines for REACT

#### NEXT_JS

- Use App Router and Server Components for improved performance and SEO
- Implement route handlers for API endpoints instead of the pages/api directory
- Use server actions for form handling and data mutations from Server Components
- Leverage Next.js Image component with proper sizing for core web vitals optimization
- Implement the Metadata API for dynamic SEO optimization
- Use React Server Components for {{data_fetching_operations}} to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Implement Streaming and Suspense for improved loading states
- Use the new Link component without requiring a child <a> tag
- Leverage parallel routes for complex layouts and parallel data fetching
- Implement intercepting routes for modal patterns and nested UIs

### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
